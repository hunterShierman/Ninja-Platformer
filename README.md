This project was created by me and three of my friends at our first Hackathon. 

Overview:
The game is a retro side scroller where the player is tasked with surviving against an onslought of enemy goblins.
After each kill, the player will receive gold which can be spent on upgrades at the in game shop.
Every 45 seconds the player will be transported to the shop area and be given a chance to spend their gold.
After each trip to the shop level, there is a 50% chance that the player will get a special chest with attribute upgrades.

The player has 8 upgradable stats:

1.) Health
2.) Attack Damage
3.) Attack Range
4.) Magic Damage
5.) Magic Range 
6.) Magic Cooldown
7.) Block Duration
8.) Magic Range
