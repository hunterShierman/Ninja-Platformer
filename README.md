This project was created by me and three of my friends at our first Hackathon. 

To run the game, run the MainGame file.

Overview:
The game is a retro side scroller where the player is tasked with surviving against an onslought of enemy goblins.
After each kill, the player will receive gold which can be spent on upgrades at the in game shop.
Every 45 seconds the player will be transported to the shop area and be given a chance to spend their gold.
After each trip to the shop level, there is a 50% chance that the player will get a special chest with attribute upgrades.

TIP: When blocking hold down shift just before the enemy attacks, do not try to time your parry - the window is extremely small and difficult to time.
